All they want is to make their immediate tomorrow and don't care about their future at all, so don't give a fuck about pahadi community and this and that.

My point is that it's only Terai people that likes to separate this and that community. And play victim card blaming \"so called other community\" when it's their own people's fault. Yes, there are some differences of opinions in locality but people of hilly and above regions don't care about this and that community overall.",

Now with technology and development, they are just another pahadi community.  It's only Terai community and pahadi community, **made by agenda of politics** . Besides, the only thing bitter here is your soul that can't help but blame making stuff like this and that community. It's politics, tell the people in Terai region not to pull their own legs each time election comes and vote their representatives. Guarenteed the prime minister that will come out will be from Terai region uncontested. But the people there have very limited thoughts.",

        "It's your thinking that's cheap. Of course there's differences according to locality. You cannot differentiate different diverse cultures that exist in Nepal just as terai community, pahadi community, himal community. It's you who should broaden your mind. Those are just regions separated according to land structure and not by people/community which you are doing wrongly. In terai there are different communities, In hilly there are different communities and in Himalayan region there are different communities. No such thing as Terai community exist, no such thing as Pahadi community exist and no such as thing as Himal community exist. And I don't from which ass you brought out Upatyaka community.",
